Experiment to try to implement Hofacker et al. 2004 RNA struct align dp 
with parallel dp using lockfree hashtables.

double/ contains the (original) version that does everything in double
        precision floating point

integer/ contains the version modified to do the dyanmic programming part
         with integer arithmetic

NB (as of July 2009), only using integer (since UltraSPARC T1 not scalable
with doulbe due to shared FPUs), so double/ code is out of date (changes
made only in integer/ version. [TODO: merge back into double/ or remove it]
