## Software

Imported from https://sites.google.com/site/alexdstivala/home/paralleldp

Note that the "shortest path" and "open stacks" code is not included as it was not originally
written by me, but rather by two of my co-authors, 
[Prof. Peter Stuckey](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~pjs) and
[A/Prof.  Maria Garcia de la Banda](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~mbanda/).

This software can be used freely for any purpose, modified, redistributed, etc.
with no restrictions. However we would appreciate it if you acknowledge
your use of it, and in particular if you would cite our paper
in any publication that makes use of it.
